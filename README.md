# python-learning-journal
# A repository to document my Python learning journey

# About me: my name is Yvette, and I can program in C/C++.  I have taken web development, javaScript and python classes, and I published a Spanish learning website that uses only HTML and CSS.
# Goals: I want to become more proficient in Python, and since I have never used AI, I look forward to learning more about that in this class.

# My first python program:  

print("Here is some simple python code")

print("Hello World!")

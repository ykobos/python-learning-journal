Hi guys,  so I used chatGPT to generate the list of countries recognized by the United Nations, and this is what I got, which I verified some, not all, through other sources:  https://chatgpt.com/share/79dd5575-906d-4c47-8b04-c522b646b4e3   - the thing is that not all the countries that participated in the 2024 olympics are listed in the UN list of countries, such as Puerto Rico.  Some sources count Puerto Rico as a separate country, others as part of the USA.    So the lists would not be compatible.     I found this list of the countries that took part in the 2024 olympics:  https://olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-olympics-full-list-ioc-national-olympic-committee-codes    and this for the medal count: https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/medals  - my question to both:  should we limit the countries to those that attended the olympics or do the UN list?   We could do a list of countries that generally participate in the olympics, saying whether this year they did or not and medal count  OR  use the UN country list (195) and do something with it besides who went to the olympics,  such as language(s) spoken.   Thoughts?

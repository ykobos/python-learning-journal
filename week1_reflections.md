I have not really learned anything new so far.  We have been told we have to use AI, and that is something I have been reading and talking to friends who are software developers about.  I found out that while using AI is fine in academic settings, in the real world, some are cautious as there could be licensing as well as intellectual property issues.  I will have a better formed opinion about using AI as the class gets going.  The original class syllabus (different instructor) did not mention AI, it was a 100% python learning class, and in my view, learning AI at this stage in python learning is not necessariyly useful, but I may change my mind toward the end of the semester, I suppose.
